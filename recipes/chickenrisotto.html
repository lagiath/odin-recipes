                <li>40g unsalted butter</li>
                <li>125ml (1/2 cup) olive oil</li>
                <li>2 brown onions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>880g (4 cups) arborio rice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves</li>
                <li>125ml (1/2 cup) dry white wine</li>
                <li>6 (about 500g) chicken thigh fillets, cut into 1cm pieces</li>
                <li>200g button mushrooms, cut into 1cm pieces</li>
                <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>120g (1 1/2 cups) finely grated parmesan</li>
                <li>Salt flakes, to season</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring the stock just to the boil in a large saucepan. Reduce heat and hold at a gentle simmer.</li>
                <li>Heat butter and 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy-based stockpot or large flameproof casserole dish over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the onion. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until soft and translucent but not coloured.</li>
                <li>Add the rice and 1 tablespoon of thyme. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until the grains appear slightly glassy.</li>
                <li>Add the wine to the rice mixture and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed.</li> 
                <li>Add a ladleful (about 125ml/1/2 cup) of the simmering stock to the rice and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
                <li>Continue adding the stock mixture, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next ladleful, for 20-30 minutes or until the rice is tender yet firm to the bite and the risotto is creamy.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining oil in a large frying pan over high heat. Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes or until chicken just starts to brown. Add the mushroom and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken mixture, parmesan and remaining thyme to the risotto and combine. Season with salt and pepper to serve.</li>
            </ol>
